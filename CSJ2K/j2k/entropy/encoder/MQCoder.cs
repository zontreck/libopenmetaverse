/// <summary>
///     This class implements the MQ arithmetic coder. When initialized a specific
///     state can be specified for each context, which may be adapted to the
///     probability distribution that is expected for that context.
///     <p>
///         The type of length calculation and termination can be chosen at
///         construction time.
///         ---- Tricks that have been tried to improve speed ----
///         <p>
///             1) Merging Qe and mPS and doubling the lookup tables
///             <br>
///                 Merge the mPS into Qe, as the sign bit (if Qe>=0 the sense of MPS is 0, if
///                 Qe
///                 <0 the sense is 1), and double the lookup tables. The first half of the
///                     lookup tables correspond to Qe>
///                     =0 (i.e. the sense of MPS is 0) and the
///                     second half to Qe
///                     <0 (i.e. the sense of MPS is 1). The nLPS lookup table is
///                         modified to incorporate the changes in the sense of MPS, by making it jump
///                         from the first to the second half and vice-versa, when a change is
///                         specified by the swicthLM lookup table. See JPEG book, section 13.2, page
///                     225. <br>
///                         There is NO speed improvement in doing this, actually there is a slight
///                         decrease, probably due to the fact that often Q has to be negated. Also the
///                         fact that a brach of the type "if (bit==mPS[li])" is replaced by two
///                         simpler braches of the type "if (bit==0)" and "if (q<0)" may contribute to
/// that.
///         
///         </p>
///         <p>
///             2) Removing cT
///             <br>
///                 It is possible to remove the cT counter by setting a flag bit in the high
///                 bits of the C register. This bit will be automatically shifted left
///                 whenever a renormalization shift occurs, which is equivalent to decreasing
///                 cT. When the flag bit reaches the sign bit (leftmost bit), which is
///                 equivalenet to cT==0, the byteOut() procedure is called. This test can be
///                 done efficiently with "c<0" since C is a signed quantity. Care must be
/// taken in byteOut() to reset the bit in order to not interfere with other
/// bits in the C register. See JPEG book, page 228.
///                 
///                 <br>
///                     There is NO speed improvement in doing this. I don't really know why since
///                     the number of operations whenever a renormalization occurs is
///                     decreased. Maybe it is due to the number of extra operations in the
///                     byteOut(), terminate() and getNumCodedBytes() procedures.
///         </p>
///         <p>
///             3) Change the convention of MPS and LPS.
///             <br>
///                 Making the LPS interval be above the MPS interval (MQ coder convention is
///                 the opposite) can reduce the number of operations along the MPS path. In
///                 order to generate the same bit stream as with the MQ convention the output
///                 bytes need to be modified accordingly. The basic rule for this is that C =
///                 (C'^0xFF...FF)-A, where C is the codestream for the MQ convention and C' is
///                 the codestream generated by this other convention. Note that this affects
///                 bit-stuffing as well.
///                 <br>
///                     This has not been tested yet.
///                     <br>
///                         <p>
///                             4) Removing normalization while loop on MPS path
///                             <br>
///                                 Since in the MPS path Q is guaranteed to be always greater than 0x4000
///                                 (decimal 0.375) it is never necessary to do more than 1 renormalization
///                                 shift. Therefore the test of the while loop, and the loop itself, can be
///                                 removed.
///                         </p>
///                         <p>
///                             5) Simplifying test on A register
///                             <br>
///                                 Since A is always less than or equal to 0xFFFF, the test "(a & 0x8000)==0"
///                                 can be replaced by the simplete test "a
///                                 < 0x8000". This test is simpler in
/// Java since it involves only 1 operation (although the original test can be
/// converted to only one operation by  smart Just-In-Time compilers)
///                                 
///                                 <br>
///                                     This change has been integrated in the decoding procedures.
///                         </p>
///                         <p>
///                             6) Speedup mode
///                             <br>
///                                 Implemented a method that uses the speedup mode of the MQ-coder if
///                                 possible. This should greately improve performance when coding long runs of
///                                 MPS symbols that have high probability. However, to take advantage of this,
///                                 the entropy coder implementation has to explicetely use it. The generated
///                                 bit stream is the same as if no speedup mode would have been used.
///                                 <br>
///                                     Implemented but performance not tested yet.
///                         </p>
///                         <p>
///                             7) Multiple-symbol coding
///                             <br>
///                                 Since the time spent in a method call is non-negligable, coding several
///                                 symbols with one method call reduces the overhead per coded symbol. The
///                                 decodeSymbols() method implements this. However, to take advantage of it,
///                                 the implementation of the entropy coder has to explicitely use it.
///                                 <br>
///                                     Implemented but performance not tested yet.
